# WorkoutTracker



## Summary

This Workout tracker app was created so the user would be able to view create and track daily workouts. Users will be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Users should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user should be able to track the distance traveled.
